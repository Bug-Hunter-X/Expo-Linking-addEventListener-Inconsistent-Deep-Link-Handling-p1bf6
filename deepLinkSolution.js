The solution involves checking for the initial URL using Linking.getInitialURL asynchronously and only adding the event listener after the app has fully loaded. The event listener also includes error handling to catch and log any potential exceptions. This approach makes the deep link handling more robust and less susceptible to the timing issues which may have caused the original bug.  A more reliable method of handling the deeplink event may involve using a more comprehensive state management solution which addresses the asynchronous nature of the event listener.
