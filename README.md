This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's Linking API where the addEventListener method for handling deep links does not consistently fire. The bug is characterized by inconsistent behavior across devices and Expo SDK versions. The solution demonstrates a workaround involving using a combination of `Linking.getInitialURL` and `Linking.addEventListener` with error handling and improved event handling logic.  The included files, deepLinkBug.js and deepLinkSolution.js, showcase the problematic and corrected code, respectively.  The inconsistent nature of the bug makes it difficult to reproduce reliably, but the provided solutions offer a robust approach to handle deep links in Expo applications.
